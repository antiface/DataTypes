1-bit systems
=============
* NOR gate => NOR is a functionally complete operation.
* The original Apollo Guidance Computer used 4,100 ICs, each one containing only a single 3-input NOR gate.
* Put the 1-bit control signal at the Center. Build everything else around it.
* The 1-bit switch flips and propagates through domino logic, radially, outwardly, omnitopologically (See: Syngergetics, Buckminster Fuller, Omnitopology)

#1-bit structures, types
* The Impulse
* The Shot Noise
* The Point Source
* Sécurité / Mayday
* The noise-bit
